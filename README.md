i intend to create a better readme at some point in the future.
```
simply put, this does two things.

*menudef.lmp adds "quick options" to the title screen, enabling the player to change important options much faster.
```
The position of the menu was changed to resemble valve layouts.
```

*MAPINFO.txt redefines the base 5 difficulties with the following:
```
1 = No Monsters
2 = Power-Fantasy
3 = Normal
4 = Survival
5 = Nightmare
```
-  No Monsters is what you think it is.
-  Power-Fantasy is forgiving, gives you a lot of enemies, and makes you deal damage multiplied by 5.
-  Normal is surprisingly good at making other difficulties more enjoyable.
-  Survival is a challenging redesign requiring you to pace yourself. Pickups & weapons are remixed and very scarce. Monsters are weaker, remixed, fast and reduced in quantity. Hitscanner enemies are severely reduced.
-  Nightmare feels like it belongs here, but I'm open to changing that.
